				<p>
					On <span class="yellow">April 8th, 2024</span>, Nintendo shut down online services for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS family of systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="blue">SpotPass</span> was a service used on these systems to distribute data for certain games via the internet. We underwent a huge effort to archive all known SpotPass data through user-submitted dumps, and it was a massive success. We ended with <span class="green bold">15,579</span> 3DS dumps and <span class="green bold">7,553</span> Wii U dumps.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the near future, we plan on publishing an archive of all of the SpotPass data we were able to grab before the shutdown. More information will be available regarding that when we have more information to share.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to your help, various <span class="purple">network revival services</span> will continue to distribute SpotPass content for many titles, ensuring that features in these titles can be used long after Nintendo has pulled the plug.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Our work's not done yet though. We have more plans for ways to archive old SpotPass data for a few specific games such as the StreetPass Mii Plaza. We hope to have more information to share on that soon.

					<span class="bold">Q.</span> What's going to happen next for the archival project?
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">A.</span> We plan on moving to archive data for some specific games in the near future. We'll have more news to share about these efforts soon.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">Q.</span> Which games have SpotPass data archived?
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">A.</span> Check the spreadsheets (<a class="blue" href="spreadsheets/3ds.html">this one</a> for 3DS, <a class="blue" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qU0o7zxILAZcI83nOidr1QSrM0maVp6OGdBqg0xwul0/htmlview">this one</a> for Wii U) to see which games have data archived. Do note that in the Wii U spreadsheet, if a game is marked as "complete", that does NOT mean that all data for that game has been collected. Rather, it means that <span class="italic">some</span> data for the game has been collected and it may or may not actually be complete.
